10. Individual Phase
====================

10.1 Draft
---------------------------

- Tsunami Mitigation Strategies
    - simulate and assess the impact of various tsunami mitigation strategies
    - algorithms to model the effectiveness of barriers, early warning systems, and evacuation plans

- Multi-resolution Simulation
    - support multi-resolution grids

    - data structures and algorithms that efficiently handle varying resolutions in different parts
      of the simulation domain

- Grid masking
    - Optimization of the calculation by applying a mask to the changing part of the simulation 
      i.e. cells that have no influence on the wave simulation are skipped, e.g. dry cells, standing water

- Real-time Visualization
    - real-time visualization using C++ graphics libraries like (OpenGL, SFML or SDL)
    - user-friendly interface to visualize the evolving tsunami simulation

- Explore GPU acceleration using NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit
    - simulation algorithms to take advantage of parallel processing on compatible NVIDIA GPUs,
      enhancing the performance

- Friction
    - Adding a friction adjustment to the implementation to obtain more accurate simulation results
